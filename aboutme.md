ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Oscar Lopez!

I'm an enthusiastic self-taught Software Engineer and Computer Science student working towards my B.S. in Computer Science. Currently, I'm working as a Contract Software Engineer at DataAnnotation.tech, where I train and fine-tune Large Language Models using TypeScript and Python. I have a passion for continuously learning new things, experimenting with cutting-edge software and technologies, and contributing to open source projects. Known for my love of distro hopping and my tendency to tinker with systems, even if it means breaking things that already worked.

The projects I've worked on really highlight my passion for continuous learning and innovation. Whether it's building an AWS Serverless CRUD API, designing a CNC G-Code Compiler, or creating a multithreaded web server in Rust, I approach every task with curiosity and technical precision. My ultimate goal? To help organizations harness data to make smarter decisions, find patterns, and drive growth.

When I'm not solving coding challenges, you'll find me exploring the outdoors on a hiking trail, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or discovering unique flavors at local cafes. These hobbies fuel my creativity and curiosity, bringing fresh perspectives to my work.

Im interested in putting my abilities foward in industry and making an impact in industry!
