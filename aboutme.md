# About Me
___
I’m a data analyst who’s passionate about solving tough problems with a blend of computer science, math, and research. As a self-taught software engineer and a Computer Science major at California State University San Marcos, I thrive where data, programming, and creativity meet. I’ve built up a versatile toolkit that includes Python, SQL, Tableau, and AWS—perfect for creating scalable solutions and delivering insights that matter.

My journey has been all about tackling challenges with a methodical approach. At Treobytes and UC San Diego, I mentored students in coding, drone programming, and circuitry while also promoting STEM education. As part of a CoOp internship at MiraCosta College, I worked hands-on with Java bytecode and ARM assembly, diving deep into low-level programming and performance optimization.

The projects I’ve worked on really highlight my passion for continuous learning and innovation. Whether it’s building an AWS Serverless CRUD API, designing a CNC G-Code Compiler, or creating a multithreaded web server in Rust, I approach every task with curiosity and technical precision. My ultimate goal? To help organizations harness data to make smarter decisions, find patterns, and drive growth.

When I’m not solving data challenges, you’ll find me exploring the outdoors on a hiking trail, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or discovering unique flavors at local cafes. These hobbies fuel my creativity and curiosity, bringing fresh perspectives to my work.

Right now, I’m especially interested in exploring how data analytics can shape fields like real estate and quantum computing. I’m all about pushing boundaries and discovering what data can truly achieve. Let’s connect and turn raw data into meaningful, game-changing results!
