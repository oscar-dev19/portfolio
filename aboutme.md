ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Oscar Lopez!


Greetings! I'm Oscar Lopez. I am a data analyst and a software engineer who enjoys building great systems that are intelligent and effective. I have a background in Computer Science & Data Analytics and love to tackle real-world problems and create exciting solutions with clean code and scalable backend services. of course, I also enjoy analyzing the data for insight when I can! 

In terms of technical skills - I've worked almost exclusively with Python, Java, C++, and SQL mostly as a developer or analyst. I have practical experience with AWS (e.g., S3, Lambda), Flask, PostgreSQL, GCP (cloud computing using cloud resources is part of my job). Additionally, regardless of what I'm doing (designing RESTful APIs, deploying cloud infrastructure, creating data visualizations, etc.) I always take an engineering perspective, and an analytical approach. 

Outside of writing code and analyzing data, I enjoy eating and drinking coffee at local cafes/restaurants; meandering around the city; working out; and tinkering with retro technology.
